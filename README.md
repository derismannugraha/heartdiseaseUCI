Analysis to predicted heart disease causes with machine learning algorithm
## Summary
The results of research conducted to predict heart disease and its causes. from the modeling carried out including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree ,and Random Forest. The modeling results above show that Random Forest has the most significant accuracy (81%) of all the modeling algorithms carried out. Next, the authors carry out further evaluations using Random Forest in predicting and knowing the cause of the disease. the heart of the existing sample data. By using the Permutation Importance and SHAP methods, it is known that from the entire sample it shows CA (Major Blood Vessels), Chest Pain: Typical Angina, and Thal (Thalassemia: Blood Disorder) which are influential factors causing heart disease
